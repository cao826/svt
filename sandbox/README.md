# Sandbox

Welcome to the Scratch Work Directory of the [Your Repository Name] repository! This directory is designated for performing various ad hoc tasks, quick computations, and storing temporary information that doesn't directly impact the core functionality of the codebase. Think of it as your personal playground for experimentation and exploration.

## Purpose

The Scratch Work Directory serves as a space for:

- Trying out random ideas and calculations.
- Storing temporary data, notes, or results.
- Developing quick utility scripts or functions.
- Conducting exploratory analysis without affecting the main codebase.

## Contents

This directory is intended for the following types of content:

- Ad hoc scripts or notebooks for quick tasks.
- Experimental code that may not be production-ready.
- Temporary data files or intermediary outputs.
- Documentation or notes related to scratch work.
